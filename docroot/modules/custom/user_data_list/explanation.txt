To fetch data from the database on a specific route in Drupal 10 and prevent caching, you can create a custom controller and define a route with caching disabled.
 Module Structure: user_data_list
user_data_list/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ user_data_list.info.yml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ user_data_list.routing.yml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/Controller/UserDataController.php

‚úÖ Summary
Route: /user-data-list
Data: Fetched from users_field_data
Caching: Disabled both at route and render level


Disabling caching in Drupal is important when you want to ensure that dynamic or frequently changing data is always fetched fresh from the database or external sources. Here's a detailed breakdown of how caching works in Drupal and how to disable it properly at different levels:
--------------------------
 1. Types of Caching in Drupal
Drupal uses multiple layers of caching:

Layer	                Description
Page Cache	            Caches entire HTML pages for anonymous users.
Dynamic Page Cache	    Caches parts of the page for both anonymous and authenticated users.
Render Cache	        Caches the rendered output of render arrays.
Route Cache	            Caches route definitions and metadata.
Data Cache	            Caches data like configuration, entities, etc.
------------------
2. Disabling Caching for a Route
In your *.routing.yml file:
my_module.my_route:
  path: '/my-data'
  defaults:
    _controller: '\Drupal\my_module\Controller\MyController::myMethod'
    _title: 'My Data'
  requirements:
    _permission: 'access content'
  options:
    no_cache: TRUE

no_cache: TRUE disables route-level caching.
This ensures the route is not cached in the router cache.
---------------------
3. Disabling Render Cache in Controller
In your controller method, you must also disable render caching:
return [
  '#type' => 'markup',
  '#markup' => $output,
  '#cache' => [
    'max-age' => 0,
  ],
];

'#cache' => ['max-age' => 0] tells Drupal not to cache the rendered output.
You can also use '#cache' => ['contexts' => [], 'tags' => [], 'max-age' => 0] for full control.
----------------------
4. Disabling Cache in Custom Blocks or Plugins
If you're using a block or plugin:
public function build() {
  return [
    '#markup' => 'Dynamic content',
    '#cache' => ['max-age' => 0],
  ];
}

------------------------------
üß™ 5. Disabling Twig Template Caching (Dev Only)
In services.yml (for development):
parameters:
  twig.config:
    debug: true
    auto_reload: true
    cache: false

Not recommended for production.
----------------------------
‚úÖ Summary: Best Practices
Use Case	            What to Do
Dynamic route	        no_cache: TRUE in routing.yml
Dynamic output	        '#cache' => ['max-age' => 0] in render array
Custom block	        Same as above
Dev environment	        Disable Twig cache in services.yml
---------------------------------------
üîß What This Module Does
Defines a route /user-data-demo
Fetches user data from the database (users_field_data)
Lists user ID, name, and email
Disables caching at both route and render levels
Demonstrates use of cache tags and cache contexts
------------------------------
üß† Cache Concepts Explained
---------------------------
‚úÖ Cache Tags
Tags allow Drupal to invalidate cached content when related data changes.
'#cache' => [
  'tags' => ['user_list'],
]
user_list: If any user is added/updated/deleted, this tag can be invalidated.
Useful for targeted cache clearing.
--------------------------
‚úÖ Cache Contexts
Contexts define variations of cached content based on conditions.
'#cache' => [
  'contexts' => ['user.roles', 'url'],
]
user.roles: Content may vary based on user role.
url: Content may vary based on the current URL.
-----------------------
‚úÖ Max Age
'max-age' => 0

Tells Drupal not to cache the rendered output at all.
Ensures fresh data is fetched every time.
------------------------
‚ö†Ô∏è Impact of Disabling Cache on Performance
Aspect	            Impact
Speed	            Slower page loads due to repeated DB queries
Scalability	        Increased server load under high traffic
Efficiency	        Reduced optimization from Drupal‚Äôs caching layers
Use Case	        Best for admin dashboards, real-time data, or debugging
üß© Tip: Use caching selectively. Disable only where necessary and use cache tags/contexts to keep content dynamic yet performant.
