  /**
   * 'Cache-Control' => 'public, max-age=3607'
   * If you set 'Cache-Control' => 'public, max-age=3607' in a custom
   * path or custom REST resource, you're essentially instructing both browsers
   * and intermediate caches (like CDNs or proxies) to store the response and
   * reuse it for up to 3607 seconds (just over an hour) without revalidating
   * it. Here's what that means in practice:
   * 
   * public: Allows the response to be cached by any cache, including shared
   * caches like CDNs or proxy servers. This is ideal for non-sensitive data
   * that can be reused across users.
   *
   * max-age=3607: Specifies that the cached response is considered fresh for
   * 3607 seconds. During this time, clients and intermediaries can serve the
   * cached version without contacting the origin server.
   *
   * Improved Performance: Reduces server load and latency for repeat
   * requests to that resource. Clients and proxies can serve the cached response instantly.
   *
   * Stale Data Risk: If the resource changes frequently, users might see outdated
   * data until the cache expires. Youâ€™ll need cache-busting
   * strategies (like versioned URLs or ETags) if freshness is critical.
   *
   * SEO and API Behavior: For public APIs or endpoints serving static
   * content (e.g., images, configuration files), this is beneficial. But
   * for dynamic or user-specific data, you might want to use private or no-cache instead.
   *
   * Security Considerations: Be cautious with public if the response contains
   * sensitive or user-specific data. It could be cached and served to unintended recipients.
   *
   * Browser Behavior: The browser stores the response and serves it from cache for
   * 3607 seconds. No network request is made during this period unless the user
   * manually refreshes or bypasses the cache.
   *
   * CDN/Proxy Behavior: If the response is marked public, shared caches (like CDNs)
   * can also store and serve it to other users for 3607 seconds.
   *
   * After 3607 Seconds: The cached response is considered stale. The browser will then:
   *    Either revalidate it using ETag or Last-Modified headers (if present), or
   *    Fetch a fresh copy from the server.
   *
   * ðŸ§ª Example Use Case
   * Letâ€™s say you have a REST endpoint /api/products that returns product data. If you set:
   *
   * Cache-Control: public, max-age=3607
   * Then:
   *    A user who hits that endpoint will get the data and store it.
   *    For the next 3607 seconds, any repeat request will use the cached version.
   *    After that, the browser will re-fetch or revalidate the data.
